##Constuct An Improved Version Of A Carousel Component 

Project to showcase an improved version of the Carousel Component

Used Snowpack as a build tool, with react/ sass used for the web page itself.

Spent a total of four hours on this, had a couple of issues getting the data to import and then be in a state where I could manipulate but once I got around that the rest was fairly smooth.
